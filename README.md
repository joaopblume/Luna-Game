# Luna-Game
 A game inspired by my dog Luna, made in pygame.

 Luna is my dog, she's 14 years old. She likes bananas and hates tomatoes.
 
 The game's goal is to get bananas as much as possible while you avoid tomatoes. Each banana you take, you get 1 point. If you touch a tomato you die, and game over.
 
 I did the game with Pygame, here are some fonts I used:

 - pygame documentation;

I got the sprites on free sprites websites, except by the dog, wich I made by myself.
All the sounds and songs were taken from free sounds sites too.
